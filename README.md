# Stonks2Midi Main Project
Welcome to Stonks2Midi's main project! We hope you enjoy the music generated from those valuable stonks.

## What is Stonks2Midi?
**Good question!** Basically Stonks2Midi is a project aimed at converting historical stock market data into nicely-sounding (most of the time) tunes with cool rhythmic patterns â”€ the higher the share price, the higher the musical note! We also provide a graph for those who are nerds/entrepreneurs.

You can choose which companies you want to listen to and assemble stock market-driven musical bands! Different companies have different grooves, so you can mix and match the companies to make groovy tunes!
